# Goal Statement

My goal for joining this Mctaba lab marathon is to build a strong foundation in real-world software development and learn how to turn ideas into working applications. I am here to gain practical skills, discipline, and confidence that will allow me to design and build useful digital products in the future. By week 30, I aim to have a functional prototype of an app, even if the idea evolves during the journey. The focus will be on solving a real problem using clean code, modern tools, and good architecture. My long-term objective is to develop an app that serves everyday users, especially people and businesses in emerging markets. This marathon is a key step toward becoming a developer who builds meaningful, scalable solutions.
